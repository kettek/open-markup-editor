## Pluggability
A key feature of OME is that of modularity, made possible through NPM modules named [Packs](docs/packs.md).

Through this system, four different types of packs can be created:
  * [Markup Packs](docs/markup-packs.md)
  * [Render Packs](docs/render-packs.md)
  * [Editor Packs](docs/editor-packs.md)
  * [Extension Packs](docs/extension-packs.md)
  
The purpose of these is outlined in the primary packs document with further details listed on each pack type's individual documentation.

... this document and those in `docs/` have been happily written in Open Markup Editor. ![:)](build/icons/16x16.png?raw=true)
